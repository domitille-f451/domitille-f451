### Hello I'm Domitille

## Web and Digital Designer

I’m a digital designer designer based in Paris. I work on commissioned and autonomous research projects, and i’m also teaching from time to time. Daily, I am trying to explore the possibilities of web technologies, question them and reposition them, mostly through the lens of interface design (theory and practice). I’m the co-founder of F451, a web design studio. We aim to bring diversity in interactions between computers and individuals and find the relevant structures for each specific content. I mainly do design and research but sometimes I code too
